# Digit-Recognizer
A simple digit recognizer

The first file implements a simple neural network to recognize handwritten digits using NumPy. The network consists of two layers with ReLU and softmax activations. Key functionalities include parameter initialization, forward propagation, backpropagation, and gradient descent for training. The model outputs predictions and calculates accuracy for evaluation.  ~80% train accuracy

This second file implements a multi-layer neural network using PyTorch. The network consists of three layers with ReLU and softmax activations, leveraging gradient descent for training. It includes functionalities for forward propagation, backpropagation, parameter updates, and accuracy evaluation. The weights are initialized using He initialization for optimal training performance.  ~95% train accuracy
